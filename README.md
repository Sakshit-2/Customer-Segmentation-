# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains information about customers such as their demographic details, services subscribed, and whether they churned or not.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing of the dataset including handling missing values, outliers, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the data distribution, visualizing relationships between variables, and understanding key insights.
- **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC-ROC.
